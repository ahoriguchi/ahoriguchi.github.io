Hello! My name is Akira Horiguchi. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Associate working with Professors Li Ma and Cliburn Chan at Duke University. My research interests include

- **Bayesian nonparametrics:** stick-breaking models, clustering, application to flow cytometry
- **Bayesian regression trees:** sensitivity analysis, computer experiments, multiobjective optimization

I completed my Ph.D. in Statistics at The Ohio State University in 2020, where I was advised by Professors Matthew T. Pratola and Thomas J. Santner. 

I completed my B.S. in Mathematics at the University of Maryland in 2015.
