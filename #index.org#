** About
I (he/him/his) am a Postdoctoral Associate of the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University, working with Professors [[https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~lm186/][Li Ma]] and [[https://scholars.duke.edu/person/cliburn.chan][Cliburn Chan]].
- Prior to this, I obtained my PhD from the Department of Statistics at The Ohio State University, advised by Professors [[http://www.matthewpratola.com/][Matthew T. Pratola]] and [[https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/santner.1/][Thomas J. Santner]].

Below are (free!) resources that I've found useful in doing research. 
** Writing 
- [[https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/reviewing-papers/knuth_mathematical_writing.pdf][Mathematical Writing]] by Donald E. Knuth, Tracy Larrabee, and Paul M. Roberts :: A quick read. 
- [[https://georgegopen.com/articles][The Science of Scientific Writing]] by George Gopen :: A classic. 
** Computing
Whichever language(s) you use, it helps to learn a little more than last time. 
- [[https://adv-r.hadley.nz/][Advanced R]] by Hadley Wickham :: The "Foundations" and "Functional programming" sections seem to be universally helpful to any Statistics PhD student who mainly uses R.
