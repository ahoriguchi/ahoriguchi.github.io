### Based on Ch 19-20 of IMS
We will see how to use the bootstrap to develop confidence intervals for a single mean

* We want to know the average price of cars on a lot by taking a random sample
* Our sample has five cars with prices
  - $18,300; $20,100; $9,600; $10,700; $27,000
  - Sample mean: $17,140
  - Standard deviation:

  \begin{align}
  s^2 &amp;= \frac{1}{5-1} \Big( (18300-17140)^2 + (20100-17140)^2 \newline \\
  &amp;\qquad\qquad+ (9600-17140)^2 + (10700-17140)^2 \newline \\
  &amp;\qquad\qquad+ (27000-17140)^2 \Big)\newline \\
  &amp;\quad\implies s = \$7,170.29
  \end{align}

How much can we expect the sample mean to change from sample to sample (of five cars)?

* If we **can** sample more from the population,&lt;br&gt; we can repeatedly:&lt;br&gt; (1) sample five cars from the population, then&lt;br&gt; (2) compute the sample mean of the five cars.&lt;br&gt; This will give us a distribution of sample means, which gives us **sample-to-sample variability**.
* If we **cannot** sample more from the population, can estimate this **sample-to-sample variability** by using the bootstrap.

Bootstrapping: take `\(B\)` bootstrap samples of size `\(n\)` from the original sample of size `\(n\)`.

* Each bootstrap sample has its own sample mean.
* There is variability across these sample means.
* This "bootstrap" variability can be an estimate&lt;br&gt; for the variability of the sample mean induced by sampling repeatedly from the population.

&lt;!-- * This bootstrap variability gives us an estimate for the variability of the sample mean from the population --&gt;

&lt;!-- * The variability across sample means across bootstrap re-samples gives us an estimate for the variability of the sample mean from the population --&gt;

Suppose we took 1,000 bootstrap samples, and for each bootstrap sample we compute its sample mean

* To develop bootstrap confidence interval for the population mean at e.g. 90% confidence level,&lt;br&gt; we can simply calculate the 5% and 95% percentile of the bootstrapped statistics

#### Computing bootstrap means and confidence intervals
Let's build a function which: takes in a sample (a vector of numerics), and then computes a desired number of bootstrap re-samples and returns the sample means for each bootstrap re-sample.

``` r
boot_samp_means &lt;- function(obs, n_resamp=10000) {
  means &lt;- numeric(n_resamp)
  num_obs &lt;- length(obs)
  for(i in 1:n_resamp) {
    resampled &lt;- sample(obs, size=num_obs, replace=TRUE)
    means[i] &lt;- mean(resampled, na.rm=TRUE)
  }
  return(means)
}
```
or 

``` r
boot_samp_means &lt;- function(obs, n_resamp=10000) {
  num_obs &lt;- length(obs)
  replicate(
      n_resamp, 
      sample(obs, size=num_obs, replace=TRUE) |&gt; mean(na.rm=TRUE)
      )
}
```

* For the car example, here's how we could do this:

``` r
obs &lt;- c(18300, 20100, 9600, 10700, 27000)
mean(obs)
#&gt; [1] 17140
bs_means &lt;- boot_samp_means(obs, 10000)
str(bs_means)
#&gt;  num [1:10000] 13300 17360 16560 20620 22360 ...
```
* To construct a 90% confidence interval, find 5th percentile and 95th percentile

``` r
(qs &lt;- quantile(bs_means, probs=c(0.05, 0.95)))
#&gt;    5%   95% 
#&gt; 12140 22140
```
* We are 90% confident that&lt;br&gt; the true average is between $12140 and $22140
&lt;!-- * We can also see variability across bootstrap samples: --&gt;
&lt;!-- ```{r} --&gt;
&lt;!-- bs_means_100 &lt;- boot_samp_means(obs, 10000) --&gt;
&lt;!-- quantile(bs_means_100, probs = c(0.05, 0.95)) --&gt;
&lt;!-- bs_means_10000 &lt;- boot_samp_means(obs, 10000) --&gt;
&lt;!-- quantile(bs_means_10000, probs = c(0.05, 0.95)) --&gt;
&lt;!-- ``` --&gt;

#### Bootstrap percentile confidence interval for a standard deviation
We have thus far focused on trying to understand the **mean** or average of a population

* Also often interested in the **standard deviation** `\(\sigma\)` (Greek letter "sigma") of the variable
* This represents the natural variability of the population value `\(\mu\)`
* Variance `\(\sigma^2\)` is just the squared value of `\(\sigma\)`
* We have constructed a **point estimate** for `\(\sigma^2\)` using samples via

$$ s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x)^2 $$
&lt;!-- * Then we have that `\(s^2\)` is a good approximation for `\(\sigma^2\)` --&gt;
* If we want to construct a *confidence interval* for `\(\sigma\)`, then we can use bootstrap idea as before.

Recall for constructing confidence interval for **population mean** using bootstrap:

- Take bootstrap re-samples of dataset
- Compute **sample mean** for each bootstrap sample
- Create histogram of **sample means** across&lt;br&gt; each bootstrap sample
- Use the percentiles of the histogram to get confidence intervals

Confidence interval for **population standard deviation** `\(\sigma\)`:

#### Mathematical model for a mean
Recall: we used the **Central Limit Theorem** to show that the variability of sample proportion is well-described by normal distribution

* For proportions, the single parameter `\(p\in [0,1]\)` determines the mean `\(p\)` and the variance `\(p(1-p)\)` (and thus s.d. `\(\sqrt{p(1-p)}\)`) 
    * Thus the only source of uncertainty is in measuring `\(p\)`
* For numerical variables, there are two sources of uncertainty:
  - The average/mean `\(\mu\)` - typical value
  - The standard deviation `\(\sigma\)` - typical variability in the parameter
* Thus we need a slightly different approach
]

.pull-right[
Central Limit Theorem for the sample mean:

- If sufficiently large number of `\(n\)` independent samples `\(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\)` from a population with mean `\(\mu\)`, s.d. `\(\sigma\)`, then:
- Sampling distribution of `\(\bar x_n\)` is approximately **normal** with mean `\(\mu\)` and s.d. `\(\sigma/\sqrt n\)`. 

However, generally do not know population-level `\(\sigma\)` - we have to estimate `\(\sigma\)`

- When you have to estimate `\(\sigma\)`, the sampling distribution of `\(\bar x_n\)` is not approximately normal, but is what's called a "t distribution"

#### `\(t\)` distribution

* The `\(t\)` distribution is defined in terms of **degrees of freedom** `df`. 
* Has a similar bell-shaped curve to normal, but has "thicker tails" -- allows for more extreme events to occur than normal


&lt;img src="lec20_files/figure-html/fig-tDistCompareToNormalDist-1.png" width="90%" /&gt;
* This shows `\(t\)` distribution with 1 df
* For normal, very little data beyond 2.5, while for t distribution, relatively more 
]

--

.pull-right[
* When looking at a dataset with `\(n\)` samples, we will typically use the `\(t\)` distribution with `\(n-1\)` df
* As df increases, the `\(t\)` distribution gets thinner tails and looks more like a standard normal 
* When df `\(&gt;30\)`, almost indistinguishable from standard normal 
* Intuition: height/thickness represents how likely values are; when df (`\(n-1\)`) is small, we are more uncertain and so more extreme values are more likely

### `\(t\)` distribution calculations
Recall in R, to calculate probabilities under **normal**,
- `pnorm(val, mean, sd)` to calculate probability that `\(N(\mu, \sigma)\)` is `\(&lt;= \text{val}\)`
- `qnorm(quantile, mean, sd)` to calculate value corresponding to `quantile`

]

.pull-right[

Similarly, for **t-distribution**, we use
- `pt(val, df)` to calculate probability that `\(t\)` distr. with `df` degrees of freedom is `\(&lt;= \text{val}\)`
- `qt(quantile, df)` to calculate value corresponding to `quantile` for `\(t\)` distr. with `df` degrees of freedom 
  


``` r
pnorms
#&gt; # A tibble: 7 × 5
#&gt;     val   pnorm   pt_2   pt_5   pt_30

2*pt(-3, df = 2)
#&gt; [1] 0.09546597

.pull-right[
* Compare with what happens with standard normal: 68-95-99.7 rule says that only 0.3% (=0.003) would be more than 3 units from the mean.
* Since `\(t\)` distribution has fatter tails, it assigns greater probability to extreme values, so we get significantly more area for `\(t\)` distribution. 
* As degrees of freedom increase, this becomes less and less the case.

### Conditions needed for using `\(t\)`-distr. confidence intervals
Previously: *if* we have independent samples and sufficiently large dataset where population has mean `\(\mu\)` and s.d. `\(\sigma\)`, then `\(\bar x_n\)` is approximately normal, with mean `\(\mu\)` and s.d. `\(\sigma/\sqrt n\)`. 

* However, we don't know `\(\sigma\)`, and if we want to use the sample estimate `\(s\)` for `\(\sigma\)` then we can't say that `\(\bar x_n\)` is approximately normal, but will instead be `\(t\)` distribution with `\(n-1\)` df under certain conditions
* Conditions needed:
  - Independent sample observations (satisfied w/ random sample)
  - Normality of samples - each `\(x_i\)` is from a normal distribution (or approximately).  How to check?
    * If `\(n&lt;30\)` and no clear outliers, then OK.
    * If `\(n\geq 30\)` and no particularly *extreme* outliers, then OK
* If these assumptions hold, then the confidence interval for the mean is

&lt;!-- \begin{aligned} --&gt;
&lt;!-- \text{point estimate} &amp;\pm t_{df}* \times SE \\ --&gt;
&lt;!-- \bar{x} &amp;\pm t_{df}* \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} --&gt;
&lt;!-- \end{aligned} --&gt;

&lt;img src="t.png" width="35%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
* `\(t^*_{df}\)` found same way as for `\(z^*\)`: 
* `\(t^*_{df}\)` is s.t. the proportion of `\(t\)` distr with `\(df\)` df within a distance `\(t^*_{df}\)` of 0 matches confidence level of interest 

---

### One sample t-intervals

* Recall if we wanted to find `\(z^*\)` corresponding to 95% confidence level, we could calculate


``` r
qnorm(1 - 0.05/2)
#&gt; [1] 1.959964

### 
* Same idea holds for finding `\(t^*_{df}\)`: to get confidence level of `\(1-\alpha\)`, we use
  - `qt(1 - alpha/2, df = df)`

``` r
qt(1 - 0.05/2, df = 5)

#### Example: mercury in tuna

* Let's calculate 95% confidence interval
* Calculate standard error:
$$ SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt n} = \frac{2.3}{\sqrt{19}} = 0.528$$
* Since df is `\(n-1=19-1\)`, calculate `\(t^*_{19-1}\)` for `\(1-0.05\)` confidence level:

``` r
qt(1-0.05/2, df = 18)
#&gt; [1] 2.100922
```
* Thus 95% confidence interval is 

$$
\begin{aligned}
\bar{x} \ &amp;\pm\  t^{\star}_{18} \times SE \newline \\
4.4 \ &amp;\pm\  2.10 \times 0.528 \newline \\
(3.29 \  &amp;, \ 5.51)
\end{aligned} 
$$
* We are 95% confident that average mercury content in tunas is between 3.29 and 5.51 micrograms per gram of tuna - very high.

#### One sample `\(t\)`-tests 
We now know how to calculate a `\(t\)`-distribution based confidence interval

* Let's look now at hypothesis tests for the mean
* **T score** is a ratio of how the sample mean differs from the hypothesized mean as compared to how the observations vary.

$$ T = \frac{\bar{x} - \mbox{null value}}{s/\sqrt{n}} $$

* When the null hypothesis is true and the conditions are met, T has a t-distribution with `\(df = n - 1.\)` Conditions:
  -   Independent observations.
  -   Large samples and no extreme outliers.

Example: testing whether runners in Washington, DC races are getting slower or faster over time

* In 2006, DC Cherry Blossom Race (10 miles) had average of 93.29 minutes
* Will use data from 100 participants from 2017 to determine whether runners are getting faster or slower (vs. possiblity of no change)
  - Null hypothesis `\(H_0\)`: average 10 mile time is same in 2006 as in 2017, so `\(\mu = 93.29\)`
  - Alternative hypothesis `\(H_A\)`: average 10 mile run time is different in 2017; `\(\mu \neq 93.29\)`

* To do the hypothesis test, same procedure as before
  - Normal setting: find Z-score using observed value, null value, standard error, then use normal distribution to calculate tail area / p value
  - This setting: T-score using observed value, null value, standard error, then use **t distribution** to calculate tail area / p value
* For sample of 100 runners, 2017 data had average of 98.78 and s.d. of 16.59; average run time in 2006 was 93.29
* First calculate standard error:

$$ SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{16.59}{\sqrt{100}} = 1.66$$

* T score:

$$ T = \frac{\text{observed}-\text{null}}{SE} = \frac{98.8 - 93.29}{1.66} = 3.32$$

* We have `\(n=100\)` observations, so `\(df=100-1=99\)`.
&lt;img src="lec20_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png" width="75%" /&gt;
* We can use `pt` to find this; by symmetry, area to right of 3.32 is same as area to left of -3.32, so

``` r
pt(-3.32, df = 99)
#&gt; [1] 0.0006305322
```
* Double this to get the p-value - 0.00126. 
* Since `\(p\)`-value is `\(&lt;0.05\)`, we can reject the null hypothesis at 95% confidence level.
  - Can reject at even 99% confidence level. 
  - Thus average run time in 2017 is different than 2006.
