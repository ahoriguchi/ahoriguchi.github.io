### A more thorough treatment of inference for proportions
In this setting, for each observation there is only a single (categorical) variable taking one of two values measuring success or failure 

* e.g. "surgical complication" or "no complication"
* Since there's only a single variable, no way to do a randomization test, so we resort to bootstrapping and mathematical models

]

.pull-right[
Let's return to the medical consultant example: 
* A consultant tries to attract patients by saying although US average complication rate for surgeries is 10%, only 3 of her 62 clients (4.8%) received them
* Not a randomized trial, so no way to actually assess whether her actions cause lower complication rate (she could have selectively chosen healthy patients)
* However, we can assess whether `\(\hat p = 0.048\)` would occur due to random chance given population average of `\(p_0 = 0.10\)`. 
* Can formulate this as a hypothesis test:
  - `\(H_0\)`: no association between consultant contributions and complication rate; `\(p=0.10\)`
  - `\(H_A\)`: patients with consultant associated with lower complication rate; `\(p&lt;0.10\)` 
* We'll estimate a "p-value": if the null hypothesis is true, what is the probability of observing a test statistic `\((\hat p)\)` that is as extreme as the one we saw?

### Sampling under the null hypothesis

What is the *sampling distribution* of the test statistic `\(\hat p\)` (proportion of complications) if `\(H_0\)` is true?

* Dataset: 3 of 62 donors had complications
* Under `\(H_0\)`, 10% of donors have complications
* Now we want to simulate additional datasets of size 62, where with probability 10%, the donor has a complication.
* Each simulated dataset will produce a proportion `\(\hat{p}_{sim} = (\# \text{ complications}) / 62\)`

Histogram will show the distribution of these simulated proportions for 10000 simulated datasets.

&lt;!-- * How to simulate?  Imagine a bag of marbles with 10% red marbles and 90% white marbles --&gt;
&lt;!-- * Pull a marble out, if red then complication, if white no complication; return marble and shuffle --&gt;
&lt;!-- * Repeat 62 times for a single bootstrap sample --&gt;

&lt;!-- * Simulating observations u
sing hypothesized null parameter value = **parametric bootstrap simulation** --&gt;

&lt;!-- * Above has results of 10,000 simulated studies,  --&gt;
&lt;!-- * Proportions `\(\leq \hat{p} = 3/62 \approx 0.0484\)` are shaded. --&gt;
* Shaded = sample proportions under null that are as extreme as observed `\(\hat{p} = 3/62 \approx 0.0484\)`. 
* 1170 simulated sample proportions were `\(\leq 3/62\)`
* We use these to construct the null distribution's left-tail area and find the p-value:

`$$\text{left area} = \frac{\text{# sims w/ }\hat{p}_{sim} \leq \text{ (3/62)}}{\text{total # sims}}$$`

* Estimated p-value is equal to this tail area: 0.117.

How do we do this in R?

* For each bootstrap sample of size `\(n=62\)`, we calculated the **proportion of succcesses**, where probability of a complication is `\(p\)` for each donor:
$$ \hat p_{sim} = \frac{\text{\# complications}}{\text{\# donors}} = \frac{\text{\# complications}}{62}. $$
* `\(\#\)` complications follows a **binomial distribution** with parameters `\(n=62\)` and `\(p=0.1\)`. &lt;br&gt;This is denoted as **Binomial(n,p)**. 

More generally, **Binomial(n,p)** models the number of successes in `\(n\)` independent trials when each trial has probability `\(p\)` of success.
* To create the 10,000 bootstrap proportions, use: 
`rbinom(n_samples, n_trials, p_success)`
    * This generates a vector of length `n_samples`, where each component is the outcome of `n_trials` where probability of success in each trial is `p_success`


&lt;!-- * The "distribution" of the number of successes in `\(n\)` trials when each "trial" has probability `\(p\)` of success is known as the **Binomial(n,p)** distribution.  --&gt;

&lt;!-- $$ \text{complication, complication, no complication, complication} $$ --&gt;
&lt;!-- $$ \longrightarrow \hat p_{sim} = \frac{\text{\# success}}{\text{\# people}} = \frac{ 3}{4}. $$ --&gt;

* Some examples of `rbinom()`:

``` r
rbinom(10, 5, 0.3)
#&gt;  [1] 3 0 0 3 0 1 2 0 2 1
rbinom(10, 5, 0.3)
#&gt;  [1] 2 0 2 1 1 2 2 0 4 3
rbinom(10, 5, 0.3)
#&gt;  [1] 1 0 1 0 1 3 1 0 3 4
```
* To convert number of successes to proportion, need to divide by number of trials



``` r
n_trials &lt;- 62
p_success &lt;- 0.1
n_bootstrap_samples &lt;- 10000
n_successes &lt;- rbinom(
  n_bootstrap_samples,
  n_trials,
  p_success
)

  stat = n_successes / n_trials)

### Mathematical model

&lt;!-- When sample size is large enough and sample observations are independent, we can use the normal distribution to describe sampling distribution of sample proportion --&gt;

The sampling distribution for `\(\hat{p}\)` based on a sample of size `\(n\)` from a population with a true proportion `\(p\)` is nearly normal when:

1.  The sample's observations are independent, e.g., are from a simple random sample.
1.  We expected to see at least 10 successes and 10 failures in the sample, i.e., `\(np\geq10\)` and `\(n(1-p)\geq10.\)`&lt;br&gt; This is called the **success-failure condition**.

When these conditions are met, then the sampling distribution of `\(\hat{p}\)` is nearly normal with mean `\(p\)` and standard error of `\(\hat{p}\)` as `\(SE(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{\frac{\ p(1-p)\ }{n}}.\)`

]

.pull-right[

&lt;!-- Recall that the margin of error is defined by the standard error. --&gt;

&lt;!-- * The margin of error for `\(\hat{p}\)` is `\(z^\star \times SE(\hat{p})\)` where `\(z^\star\)` is calculated from a specified percentile on the normal distribution. --&gt;
&lt;!--   - e.g. `\(z^* = 2\)` corresponds to 95% margin of error, `\(z^*=3\)` for 99% --&gt;
#### Checking the two conditions

How do we check the success-failure condition when typically we don't know the true proportion `\(p\)`? 

We can estimate `\(p\)` with...

- ...the sample proportion `\(\hat{p}\)`, if computing confidence intervals;
- ...the null value `\(p_0\)`, if performing a hypothesis test.

The independence condition is a more nuanced requirement (outside the scope of this class).

### Confidence interval
Provides a range of plausible values for proportion `\(p\)`

* When the sample proportion `\(\hat{p}\)` can be modeled using a normal distribution, a confidence interval for proportion `\(p\)` takes the form
$$ \hat p \pm z^* \times SE(\hat{p})$$
where
$$ SE(\hat p) = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}n}.$$
* Since `\(p\)` is unknown, we typically use
`$$SE(\hat{p}) \approx \sqrt{\frac{(\mbox{best guess of }p)(1 - \mbox{best guess of }p)}{n}}$$`
* `\(z^*\)` is a threshold depending upon level of confidence desired `\((z^*=1.96\)`: 95% level)


&lt;!-- * For hypothesis testing, null `\(p_0\)` is used; for confidence intervals, `\(\hat p\)`.  --&gt;

Example: random sample of 826 payday loan borrowers, assessing interest in regulation for payday loans.  70% of the responders say they support regulations.


1.  Is it reasonable to model the sample-to-sample variability of `\(\hat{p}\)` using a normal distribution?

1.  Estimate the standard error of `\(\hat{p}.\)`

1.  Construct a 95% confidence interval for `\(p,\)` the proportion of payday borrowers who support increased regulation for payday lenders.

1. Data are a random sample, so reasonable to assume independent observations that represent the population. Need to check success-failure condition.  We don't have `\(p\)`, so have to use `\(\hat p\)` to estimate it:
    - `\(\text{Support: } n p \approx 826 \times 0.70 = 578\)`
    - `\(\text{Not: } n (1 - p) \approx 826 \times (1 - 0.70) = 248\)`
Both are &gt;10, so success-failure holds. 
2.  Since `\(p\)` is unknown, we use `\(\hat p\)` to estimate the standard error,
`$$SE = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{0.70 (1 - 0.70)} {826}} = 0.016.$$`
3. Using the point estimate `\(\hat{p} = 0.70\)`, `\(z^{\star} = 1.96\)` for a 95% confidence interval, and the standard error `\(SE = 0.016\)` from above:
`$$\hat{p} \pm z^{\star} \times SE = 0.70 \pm 1.96 \times 0.016$$`
The confidence interval is then `\((0.669, 0.731)\)`.

&lt;!-- - `\(\hat{p} \pm z^{\star} \times 0.016 = (0.669, 0.731)\)`. --&gt;

&lt;!-- \begin{align} --&gt;
&lt;!-- \text{point estimate} \ &amp;\pm \ z^{\star} \times \ SE \\ --&gt;
&lt;!-- 0.70 \ &amp;\pm \ 1.96 \ \times \ 0.016 \\  --&gt;
&lt;!-- (0.669 \ &amp;, \ 0.731) --&gt;
&lt;!-- \end{align} --&gt;

### Changing the confidence level

If we want more confidence that our confidence interval contains `\(p\)`, the interval should be LARGER to account for greater uncertainty.

&lt;!-- If we want to increase our confidence level, the confidence interval should be LARGER, to account for greater uncertainty; decrease our confidence level, interval should be smaller. --&gt;

* The 95% conf. interval takes the form 
`$$\text{point estimate} \ \pm \ 1.96 \ \times \ SE$$`
* 1.96 corresponds to the 95% confidence level
* 2.58 corresponds to 99% confidence level
* Where do these numbers come from? The normal approximation.

&lt;img src="lec18_files/figure-html/fig-choosingZForCI-1.png" width="90%" /&gt;
* We can compute these more exactly using `qnorm()`: quantile function
* 99% confidence interval corresponds to 0.5% tail on each side. (0.5% + 99% + 0.5% = 100%)
* By symmetry, we can just look for the value corresponding to 0.5th percentile.

``` r
qnorm(0.005) # for 99%
#&gt; [1] -2.575829
qnorm(0.025) # for 95%
#&gt; [1] -1.959964
```

### Hypothesis test for a proportion
We use **Z scores** to quickly assess how likely/unlikely the sample proportion differs from a hypothesized proportion.

* It normalizes the observed difference by the standard error (expected variability in the sample proportion) under the null hypothesis.  

`$$Z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{SE(p_0)} = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{p_0(1 - p_0)/n}}$$`

* When null hypothesis is true, and when the samples are independent and we have sufficiently many samples,
`$$np_0 \geq 10, \quad n(1-p_0)\geq 10,$$`
then `\(Z\)` is approximately a standard normal distribution `\(N(0,1)\)`.

&lt;!-- Example: let's again consider whether payday loan borrowers support regulation on the loans that require evaluating debt payments.  Suppose we have a random sample of 826 borrowers, and 51% said they support regulation.  Is it reasonable to use a normal distribution to model `\(\hat p\)`?  What hypothesis should we be testing? --&gt;

&lt;!-- * Independence holds because it's a random sample; and `\(np_0 = 413\)` and `\(n(1-p_0)=413\)` (we are using the null parameter `\(p_0=0.5\)` here).  Thus normal model is applicable. --&gt;
&lt;!-- * `\(H_0\)`: not support for regulation, `\(p\leq 0.5\)`. --&gt;
&lt;!-- * `\(H_A\)`: support for regulation, `\(p&gt;0.5\)`.  --&gt;
&lt;!-- * `\(SE = \sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}n} = \sqrt{\frac{0.5(1-0.5)}{826}} = 0.017\)`.  --&gt;

Example: let's again consider whether payday loan borrowers support regulation on the loans that require evaluating debt payments.  Suppose we have a random sample of 826 borrowers, and 51% said they support regulation.

Is it reasonable to model `\(\hat p\)` w/ a normal distribution?  
* Independence holds because it's a random sample; and `\(np_0 = 413\)` and `\(n(1-p_0)=413\)` (we are using the null parameter `\(p_0=0.5\)` here).  Thus normal model is reasonable.

What hypothesis should we be testing?
* `\(H_0\)`: not support for regulation, `\(p\leq 0.5\)`.
* `\(H_A\)`: support for regulation, `\(p&gt;0.5\)`. 

Under a significance level `\(\alpha = 0.05\)`, should we reject `\(H_0\)` given the data?
* Let's first try deciding using Z-score.
* `\(SE(p_0) = \sqrt{\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}n} = \sqrt{\frac{0.5(1-0.5)}{826}} = 0.017\)`. 
]

.pull-right[

* Based on the normal model, the test statistic can be computed as the Z score of the point estimate:
`$$Z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{SE(p_0)} = \frac{0.51 - 0.5}{0.017} = 0.59$$`
`\(\hat{p}\)` within 1 std dev of the mean, so don't reject `\(H_0\)`
* Now try p-value (area of shaded region).
&lt;img src="lec18_files/figure-html/fig-normTail-51-1.png" width="100%" /&gt;



&lt;!-- $$ --&gt;
&lt;!-- \begin{align} --&gt;
&lt;!-- Z &amp;= \frac{\text{point estimate} - \text{null value}}{SE} \\ --&gt;
&lt;!--   &amp;= \frac{0.51 - 0.50}{0.017} \\ --&gt;
&lt;!--   &amp;= 0.59 --&gt;
&lt;!-- \end{align}  --&gt;
&lt;!-- $$ --&gt;

* Tail area which represents the p-value is 0.2776.
* B/c p-value is larger than 0.05, do not reject `\(H_0.\)` 

Conclusion: The poll does not provide convincing enough evidence that a majority of payday loan borrowers support loan regulations.
