*Statistical inference* is concerned with understanding and quantifying *uncertainty* in parameter estimates

* Data is typically collected to answer a research question about a larger group called a *population*
    * Polls: voters who were polled vs entire population of voters
    * Clinical trials: a study's subjects vs entire population who has a particular disease
* Recall: in linear regression we estimated a slope and intercept from data.
* Do these well represent the slope and intercept of the population?
* Depends on if the data is a representative subset of the population.

How representative of the population is the data?

- Consider two datasets collected from the same population using the same (randomized) methods
- These two datasets will typically not be identical; this is due to *randomness*
- Quantifying the variability in the data is neither obvious nor easy to do, i.e., answering the question “how different is one dataset from another?” is not trivial.
- Studying randomness of this form is a key focus of statistics.

The goal of inference is to quantify how likely certain outcomes are due to random chance vs. due to real differences.

* Think through what would happen if we repeatedly took different surveys of people's opinions on support for some policy.
* There will be some natural sample-to-sample variation, but if there is a big difference in support for vs. against the policy, this randomness will be drowned out by the true difference in the population preference.
* The coming lectures will discuss the *hypothesis testing* framework: allows for formally evaluating claims about populations

Let's look at two motivating examples.

&lt;!-- First discuss the *hypothesis testing* framework: allows for formally evaluating claims about populations --&gt;

&lt;!-- Notation:  --&gt;

&lt;!-- * `\(p\)` to denote population proportion (e.g. proportion of population supporting some policy), `\(\hat p\)` to denote *sample* proportion (e.g. taking a survey  of 1,000 people on whether they support a policy) --&gt;
&lt;!-- * `\(\mu\)` denotes population mean (e.g., average height of all US citizens) and `\(\bar x\)` to denote sample mean (e.g., average height of students in this classroom) --&gt;

### 1970s Discrimination Study
This study investigated sex discrimination in 1970s

* Question we investigate: "Are female employees discriminated against in promotion decisions made by their male managers?"

``` r
openintro::sex_discrimination |&gt; str()
#&gt; tibble [48 × 2] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)
#&gt;  $ sex     : Factor w/ 2 levels "male","female": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
#&gt;  $ decision: Factor w/ 2 levels "promoted","not promoted": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
```


``` r
table(sex_discrimination)
#&gt;         decision
#&gt; sex      promoted not promoted
#&gt;   male         21            3
#&gt;   female       14           10
```
- Proportion of promoted males: `\(\hat{p}_M = 21 / 24\)`
- Proportion of promoted females: `\(\hat{p}_F = 14 / 24\)`
- Difference of proportions: `\(\hat{p}_M - \hat{p}_F = 0.292\)`

&lt;!-- * Note that we only have a single variable, and this is *observational data*.  Without a truly randomized study, with care taken to ensure that the two groups (here: male/female) are equal among other characteristics (e.g. seniority, number of years worked, etc.) our statistical inference may not be valid.  But let us --&gt;
* We can formulate two competing claims about the relationship between sex and promotions:
  - `\(H_0\)`, **Null hypothesis**: variables `sex` and `decision` are independent.  Any observed differences in proportions promoted are due to natural variability.
        - E.g.: `\(p_M = p_F\)`.
  - `\(H_A\)`, **Alternative hypothesis**: variables `sex` and `decision` are *dependent*.  Observed differences in proportions are due to dependence between the two variables.
        - E.g.: `\(p_M &gt; p_F\)`.
* Here we only have a single predictor variable, and this is *observational data*. We cannot say that sex *caused* difference in hiring outcomes.
    * Correlation does not imply causation!
    * To infer causality, would need a truly randomized study, with care taken to ensure that the two groups (here: male/female) are equal among other characteristics (e.g. seniority, number of years worked, etc.).

### Variability of the statistic

We can examine whether the null hypothesis `\(H_0\)` is true by using a **permutation test**.

* If the two variables `sex` and `decision` were independent, then if we shuffled all of the labels of "male" and "female", then the proportion with each `decision` would be roughly the same
* If the proportion within each decision are very different than in the sample that we saw, then there is evidence that `\(H_0\)` is *not* true

Let's now shuffle the labels of male / female among the 48 study subjects, but keep fixed the number of males, females, number of promoted / not promoted. 

- See figures on right: 35 red cards ("promoted") and 13 white cards ("not promoted") get shuffled; resulting card deck then split in half.

### Observed statistic vs. null statistics

&lt;img src="sex-rand-03-shuffle-1-sort.png" width="100%" /&gt;

- Shuffle `\(\#1\)` results in proportion difference of `\(\hat{p}_{M,1} - \hat{p}_{F,1} = 0.042\)`.
- We can perform multiple shuffles to see the distribution of the proportion differences under the null hypothesis `\(H_0\)`

### Example: college student savings

Let's consider a study where we ask whether telling a college student that they can save money for later purchases will make them spend less now

-   `\(H_0:\)` **Null hypothesis**. Reminding students that they can save money for later purchases will not have any impact on students' spending decisions.
-   `\(H_A:\)` **Alternative hypothesis**. Reminding students that they can save money for later purchases will reduce the chance they will continue with a purchase.
* Dataset: `opportunity_cost` in *openintro*

``` r
opportunity_cost
#&gt; # A tibble: 150 × 2
#&gt;   group   decision 
#&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;    
#&gt; 1 control buy video
#&gt; 2 control buy video
#&gt; 3 control buy video

*"Imagine that you have been saving some extra money on the side to make some purchases, and on your most recent visit to the video store you come across a special sale on a new video. This video is one with your favorite actor or actress, and your favorite type of movie (such as a comedy, drama, thriller, etc.). This particular video that you are considering is one you have been thinking about buying for a long time. It is available for a special sale price of $14.99. What would you do in this situation? Please circle one of the options below."*

Half of the 150 students were randomized into a control group and given the following options:

&gt; (A) Buy this entertaining video.

&gt; (B) Not buy this entertaining video.

Remaining 75 students were placed in treatment group, they saw: 

&gt; (A) Buy this entertaining video.

&gt; (B) Not buy this entertaining video. Keep the $14.99 for other purchases.


``` r

* See that under treatment, about 20 percentage points higher choose not to buy the video
* How much variability would one expect if the treatment had no effect?  
* We can do the same type of analysis from the previous setting
  - Assume we have 53 people labeled "not buy video", 97 labeled "buy video"
  - Imagine we have index cards with these labels, then we shuffle them and divide into two stacks of 75 people each
  - We imagine each stack is a new "control" and "treatment" group
  - Any difference between proportions of "buy" and "not buy" cards will be due entirely to random chance 
  - We should generally expect each stack to have `\(\approx 53/2 = 26.5\)` "not buy" cards each

   &lt;td style="text-align:right;width: 7em; "&gt; 150 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;



From this table, we can compute a difference that occurred from the first shuffle of the data (i.e., from chance alone):

`$$\hat{p}_{T, shfl1} - \hat{p}_{C, shfl1} = \frac{24}{75} - \frac{29}{75} = - 0.067$$`
* Compare this to the 20 percentage points (0.2) that we saw before.
* Repeat 1000 times; plot results on the right.

* Only 6 of the 1,000 randomizations had as extreme a result

### Hypothesis testing
In previous problems, we described a *hypothesis test*:

- **Null hypothesis**: default assumption, skeptical, belief that things could have happened due to chance
- **Alternative hypothesis**: hypothesis that there is some relationship between variables
  
Way to think about it: trial by jury
- Null hypothesis: not guilty.
- Alternative hypothesis: guilty.
- We might reject the null in favor of the alternative *if* there is significant evidence in favor of this claim.
- Failure to reject the null does NOT mean null is true, just that we don't have enough evidence to reject the null. (Innocent until proven guilty.)

### p-values and statistical significance

### p-values and statistical significance

&lt;!-- * `\(p\)`-value represents the probability that, if the null hypothesis is true and a linear model is the correct model of the data, that we would obtain data that is at least as extreme as the result actually observed --&gt;
More generally, a `\(p\)`-value represents the probability that, if the null hypothesis is true and a linear model is the correct model of the data, that we would obtain data that is at least as extreme as the result actually observed

* When the `\(p\)`-value is smaller than a threshold (**significance level** `\(\alpha\)`), then we say results are *statistically significant at level `\(\alpha\)`*, and we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative.
* Example: in video experiment, we showed that participants had a 20% drop in likelihood of purchasing if we remind about saving money.
  - Only 6 of 1,000 had as extreme a result, so the `\(p\)`-value is 0.006. 
  - Statistically significant at level `\(\alpha=0.05\)` and at level `\(\alpha=0.01\)`.

### Randomization tests summary
* Frame research qeustion in terms of hypotheses
  - Null hypothesis `\(H_0\)`: skeptical of any relationship between variables
  - Alternative hypothesis `\(H_A\)`: posits a relationship between variables
* Collect data
* Model randomness that would occur if null hypothesis were true
  - Randomize treatments
* Analyze data and identify `\(p\)`-value
* Form conclusion about hypotheses using `\(p\)`-value

#### Examples
Let's describe null and alternative hypotheses in words and symbols for the following:

- Starting in 2008, chain restaurants in CA have displayed calorie counts for each menu item.
- Before 2008, we randomly sampled restaurants and recorded whether a person consumed &gt; 2000 calories at the chain restaurant.
- After 2008, we returned and again randomly sampled restaurants and recorded whether a person consumed &gt; 2000 calories at the chain restaurant.
- We want to see if the data provide convincing evidence of a difference in average calorie intake.

**Null hypothesis** `\(H_0\)`: calorie intake is the independent of whether we display number of calories per item.

**Alternative hypothesis** `\(H_A\)`: calorie intake is affected by display of number of calories per item.

.pull-left[

Let's suppose we had data as follows:

|  | No cal. display | Cal. display | Total |
| -------- | --------- | ------- | ----- |
| &gt;2000 cal | 825 | 350 | 1175 |
| &lt;2000 cal | 1605 | 1800 | 3605 | 
| Total | 2430 | 2150 | 4580 |


Convert this into proportions:

|  | No calorie display | Calorie display | 
| -------- | --------- | ------- |
| &gt;2000 cal | 0.339 | 0.163 | 
| &lt;2000 cal | 0.661 | 0.837 | 

* *Treatment* here is having calorie display
* We see a difference in proportion eating &gt;2000 calories as:
$$ 0.163 - 0.339 = -0.176 $$
* How likely would this have happened if the calorie display did not affect how much people ate? (i.e., if `\(H_0\)` were true?)
]

.pull-right[
* We simulate below 200 different randomizations of the data, keeping the total number of &gt;2000 and &lt;2000 cal fixed but shuffling "no calorie display" and "display" to the groups.
&lt;img src="lec14_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="360" /&gt;

* We see that the typical difference in proportions is never as much as what we observed (-0.176), so there is significant evidence to reject `\(H_0\)`.
* None of the simulation's 200 instances result in a difference `\(&lt; -0.176\)`, so the `\(p\)`-value is `\(&lt; 1/200\)`.
